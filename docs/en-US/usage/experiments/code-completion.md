# Code Completion

::: danger
This feature is experimental and may not work as expected. Use it at your own risk.
:::

::: info
It's a very early prototype and is far from being a complete solution. It will **NOT** be finished in this state and will be replaced with a fully functional version in the future.
:::

**Code Completion**, called **Auto Completion** in the experiment list, is a feature that provides suggestions for completing code as you type.

## How to use

1. Enable the "Auto Completion" experiment in the `Experiments` section of the settings.
2. Open a file in the editor (it won't work in files opened before enabling the experiment).
3. Start typing code in the editor. There are a very limited number of suggestions available, like `command`, `send`, `if` (they paste entire sections) etc. It should also suggest variable names.
