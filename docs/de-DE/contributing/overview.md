# Contributing

Do you want to contribute to this project? Awesome! Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## Code rules

See [code rules](./code-rules) for detailed coding guidelines.

## Pull requests

You should base your work on the `dev/dev` branch instead of the `main` branch. The `main` branch is reserved for stable releases, while the `dev` branch is where all the development happens.

## Bug fixes

Bug fixes are always welcome and appreciated, so please don't hesitate to submit a pull request if you find a bug in the code!

## Features

Features are a bit trickier. If you want to implement a new feature, it would be best to ask first on Discord - either privately (by messaging Notro) or in the Discord server.
This way, we can discuss the feature first. I wouldn't want your work to go to waste!
