# Projects

::: danger
This feature is experimental and may not work as expected. Use it at your own risk.
:::

::: info
While this is an experimental feature, Projects is more stable than other experiments and is actively used in production. It will be further developed and improved in the future.
:::

::: tip Important Note
The experiment toggle doesn't actually do anything - the feature is always enabled due to changes made a while back.

You **don't** need to enable the experiment to use Projects. You can use it right away from the sidebar.
:::

**Projects** is a feature that lets you open folders inside SkEditor. Technically, it doesn't implement "projects" in the traditional sense, but rather allows you to open a folder and work with files inside it.

Many features aren't implemented yet, like detecting file changes in the folder. In the future, a full-fledged project management system will be implemented.
